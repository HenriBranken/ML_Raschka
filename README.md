# Python_ML_Raschka_Mirjalili

This repository works through the majority of theory and coding examples presented in the book:  "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka & Vahid Mirjalili.

The repository is also layed out chapter by chapter as it is presented in the original textbook.

At present, it contains 11 out of the 15 chapters discussed in the textbook, and as such this repository is still a work in progress.

    "Via the ```fit``` method, we initialize the weights in ```self.w_``` to a vector ${\\rm I\\!R}^{m+1}$.\n",
    "$m$ stands for the number of dimensions (features) in the dataset, where we add 1 for the first element in this vector that represents the bias unit.  Remember that the first element in this vectory, ```self.w_[0]```, represents the so-called bias units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice that this vector contains small random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with standard deviation ```0.01``` via ```rgen.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.01, size=1 + X.shape[1])```, where ```rgen``` is a NumPy random number generator that we seeded with a user-specified random seed so that we can reproduce the previous results if so desired.\n",

    "Now, the reason we don't initialise the weights to zero, is that the learning rate $\\eta$ only has an effect on the classification outcome if the weights are initialized to non-zero values.  If all the weights are initalized to zero, the learning rate parameter affects only the scale of the weight vector, no the direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the weights have been initialised, the ```fit``` method loops over all the individual samples in the training set and updates the weights according to the perceptron learning rule that we discussed in the previous section.  The class labels are predicted by the predict method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we also collect the number of misclassifications during each epoch in the ```self.errors_``` list so that we can later analyze how well our perceptron performed during the training."
